# Bank Account

![Alt Text](https://travis-ci.org/Simba14/bank-tech-test.svg?branch=master)

Simple banking application written in Ruby, used as a practice tech test for interview preparation.

The key concepts that I attempted to adhere to were:
* Object-oriented design
* Test-driven development
* Concise methods
* Seperation of concerns

### User stories
```
As a User
So that I can store my money safely
I need to deposit it into my account

As a User
So that I can purchase goods / services
I need to be able to withdraw money from my account

As a User
So that I know how much money I have deposited
I need to be able to view my balance

As a User
So that I can keep track of my finances
I need to be able to view my account history
```
